This was one of the first projects for completion of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND).

I was a new python / jupyter notebook learner at this point.
I've since received / completed the Udacity certificate for the Data Analyst Nanodegree, 
but I'm still learning, and will continue learning and practicing. :)
